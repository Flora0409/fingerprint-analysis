// NOTE: Be sure you have defined your bitmaps by assigning them a resource
//       id of a quoted string (i.e. "BITMAP1" instead of ID_BITMAP1) since 
//       you will be designating the bitmaps by their quoted resource string
//       in this file.

//       Be sure that you do not leave a space between the quoted bitmap
//       resource name and the \b identifier when setting up your array.
//       "BITMAP1\b" = correct
//       "BITMAP1 \b" = incorrect

//      Thanks to Gerry Shaw for submitting code to fix the redraw so that only
//      the actual display window refreshes each time instead of the entire 
//      dialog which was causing annoying flicker.
